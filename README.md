# eCommerce
This is a mock e-Commerce website like amazon/flipkart. 

Steps to do: 
1. Backend with Node.js/express.js
2. Mongo db instance to store the files. 
3. Frontend using either Next.js(probably this is my choice)/React. 
4. Redux for the state-management. 

// Initialize a node project
// Put a package.json
